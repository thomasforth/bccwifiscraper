# Birmingham City Council free WiFi access spot scraper
Scraping the free WiFi access spots listed on Birmingham City Council's website

## How to run
Download the repository. Download Visual Studio 2019. Open the .sln file. Press Run.

Or if you want to download less and struggle more. The code is written in .NET Core 2.2 -- you can [download the runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2) and run it somehow, probably here. I can't promise that'll be easy though, especially if either of the libraries I've used are not cross-platform.

## The result
This tool creates a .csv file of all 177 (as of 2019-04-09) access point for free WiFi by Birmingham City Council. I've included it. It's called `WiFiPoints.csv`.
